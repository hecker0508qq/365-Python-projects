# 365-Python-projects
We create and solve 365 tasks in Python.

## 8 days before - Creative task: The "Guess the Number" game: 
> The repository has been created. Every day, starting from January 1, 2025 and ending on January 1, 2026, every day I will release a solution to problems from the Internet, or create my own tasks. Today I decided to create a task to understand the process and understand what I am facing.
> 
**The purpose of the task:** Write a Python program that implements the "Guess the Number" game. The player will be asked to guess a random number generated by the computer in a given range.

### Implementation steps:

1. **Random Number generation:**
  - Use the `random` module to generate a random number in a given range (for example, from 1 to 100).

2. **User input request:**
  - The program should ask the user to enter a number and check its correctness (for example, whether it is a number and whether it is in the acceptable range).

3. **Checking assumptions:**
  - After entering a number, the program must inform the user whether he guessed the number, or whether his number is greater or less than the one he guessed.

4. **Number of attempts:**
  - Add an attempt counter. The program should tell the user how many attempts he has used, and give him the opportunity to continue the game or finish it.

5. **Adding difficulty levels:**
  - Implement several difficulty levels that will change the range of numbers (for example, "Easy" — from 1 to 10, "Medium" — from 1 to 50, "Difficult" — from 1 to 100).

6. **Hints:**
  - Add the ability to give hints to the user, for example, "the number is even" or "the number is divisible by 3".

7. **Repeating the game:**
  - After completing the game, invite the user to play again.
